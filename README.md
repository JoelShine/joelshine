# About Me

Hello Everyone ! My name is Joel Shine. I am a student of programming trying to learn bits and bytes by observing the world around me.

I have been coding since I got my first computer. I love programming and love to learn the different aspects of it.

I currently know the following languages :

- **Java**
- **Python**
- **C++**
- **C**
- **Golang**
- **_and more_**

I am interested in learning other languages. I am just a beginner in C and currently I am learning Javascript.

I am just a school student, who loves to make projects to help the people and the society for a better well-being.

Some of my popular Github repositories are :

1 ) [Jarvis v2.0](https://github.com/JoelShine/Jarvis-v2.0) - An AI Speech and Text Assistant to carry out and automate your computer tasks.

2 ) [Text editor in Python](https://github.com/JoelShine/Text-Editor-in-Python) - A simple text editor in Python which supports both light and dark themes.

3 ) [Goython](https://github.com/JoelShine/Goython-Python-shell-in-Golang) - A python shell written and compiled in Golang. Currently it can print statements only. Other functionalties would be added soon.

Thanks for Supporting ðŸ˜Š
