Hello Everyone ! My name is Joel Shine. I am a student of programming trying to learn bits and bytes by observing the world around me.

I have been coding since I got my first computer. I love programming and love to learn the different aspects of it.

I am interested in learning other languages. I am just a beginner in C and currently I am learning Javascript.

I am just a school student, who loves to make projects to help the people and the society for a better well-being.
